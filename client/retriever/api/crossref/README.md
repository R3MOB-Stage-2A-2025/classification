# Client - Crossref API

[***Habanero***](https://github.com/sckott/habanero/) wrapper.

The goal of this app is to code a wrapper on the *Crossref API* client
called *Habanero*.

## TODO

- Should verify the request status such as ``if (response.ok == 1)``...

- Add *CORS*.

- Add *HTTPS*.

- (Open question): How to prevent from *denial of services*?

- Add some *try catch* in the client to find errors.
